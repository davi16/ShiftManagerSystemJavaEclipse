Project name: Shift Manager System.

Description: 

			 This project is responsible for handling shifts in a convenient way.
			
			 Has 3 types of users: manager, shift manager and employee.
			
			 The administrator has all permissions available in the system.
			
			 The shift manager has permissions for managing a said shift.
			 
			 The employees only have permissions to access their data, shifts and to enter/leave a shift.
			 
Functions and/or Features:

			 The system handles all inputs via the main program class.
			
			 Initially the system asks for details of a manager, and than opens a dedicated menu to add more employees to the system etc.
			 
			 There are 4 main design patterns, see included My Design Patterns.pdf file to learn more about them.
			 
			 The project has a very intricate system with lots of different connections, you can find visual representation in the included UML files.
			 
Instructions:

			 Make sure to follow the instructions about input precisely else the program won't accept your inputs.
			 
			 Make sure to remember your user name and password at all times, else you won't be able to connect to the system again.
			
			 Currently there is no permanent storing of data for the system, any data you will insert will be lost as soon as you close the program.

Log in:	to enter the system, we provided you a test user name and password:

user name: admin
password: 123456
